	<h2>Why Donate Blood?</h2>
<p>Blood is the living fluid that all life is based on. Blood is composed of 60% liquid part and 40% solid part. The liquid part called Plasma, made up of 90% water and 10% nutrients, hormones, etc. is easily replenished by food, medicines, etc. But the solid part that contains RBC (red blood cells), WBC (white blood cells) and Platelets take valuable time to be replaced if lost.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. The time taken by a patient's body to replace it could cost his/her life. Sometimes the body might not be in a condition to replace it at all.</p>
<p>As you know blood cannot be harvested it can only be donated. This means only you can save a life that needs blood.</p>
<p>Every year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available.</p>
<p>Saving a life does not require heroic deeds. You could just do it with a small thought and an even smaller effort by saying "yes".</p>
